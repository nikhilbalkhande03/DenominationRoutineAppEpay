1. Denomination routine
An ATM has three cartridges for different denominations:
•	10 EUR cartridge
•	50 EUR cartridge
•	100 EUR cartridge
Now we want to pay out following amounts from the ATM:
•	30 EUR
•	50 EUR
•	60 EUR
•	80 EUR
•	140 EUR
•	230 EUR
•	370 EUR
•	610 EUR
•	980 EUR
Write a program which will calculate for each payout the possible combinations which the ATM can pay out.
For example, for 100 EUR the available payout denominations would be:
•	10 x 10 EUR
•	1 x 50 EUR + 5 x 10 EUR
•	2 x 50 EUR
•	1 x 100 EUR
